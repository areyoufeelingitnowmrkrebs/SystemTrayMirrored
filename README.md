All you have to do is clone this repo and then move "org.kde.plasma.systemtray" to ~/.local/share/plasma/plasmoids

After you've moved the folder, right click anywhere on your panel and select "Add or Manage Widgets"

"System Tray Mirrored" should be the very first thing that appears since it is new, if not just search "Mirrored"

You are done. Enjoy. (:
